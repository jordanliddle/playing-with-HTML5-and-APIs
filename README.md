#HTML5 and its various APIs

In December last year, I purchased [HTML5 for Masterminds](http://www.minkbooks.com/) by _J.D. Gauchat_. It was a great read, packed with tons of information on how to take advantage of new HTML5 features and various APIs including:

* **TextTrack API** 
* **Fullscreen API** 
* **Stream API** 
* **Canvas API** 
* **WebGL and Three.js** 
* **Pointer Lock API** 
* **Drag and Drop API** 
* **Geolocation API** 
* **Web Messaging API** 
* **and much more** 


This repository isn't a showcase to demo some of my favorite APIs, rather a bundle of code snippets in relation to the various HTML5 things I've learnt and am still learning. 


Stay tuned, I'll organize the code in due time!
